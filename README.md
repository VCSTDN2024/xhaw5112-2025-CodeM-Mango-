# Empowering The Nation - Digital Platform

*Skills to thrive, power to lead.*

A vibrant, user-friendly website and mobile application designed to make training accessible, intuitive, and empowering for domestic workers and gardeners in South Africa.

---

## The Problem

Domestic workers and gardeners often lack access to affordable, structured training and business support. This problem is exacerbated by limited digital access and few opportunities for formal upskilling. Our client, *Empowering the Nation* (founded by Precious Radebe in 2022), aims to bridge this gap.

## Our Solution

We designed and built a cohesive digital platform comprising a responsive website and a cross-platform mobile app. The solution is tailored specifically for users with varying levels of digital literacy and limited data access.

*Key Features of the Platform:*
- *Comprehensive Course Catalogue:* Clear separation of Six-Month Learnerships and Six-Week Short Skills programmes.
- *Interactive Enquiry & Discount Calculator:* Real-time cost calculation with automatic multi-course discounts.
- *Business & Support Tools:* Integrated quote forms, live chat, and multiple contact methods.
- *User-Centered Design:* A bright, fruity colour palette and intuitive navigation designed for low-data usage.

## What We Built

This repository contains the source code for two main products:

### 1. The Website
A static, responsive website built with *HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript*.
- *Key Pages:* Home, About, Courses (x2), Enquiry, Contact.
- *Core Feature:* The Enquiry page includes a dynamic JavaScript calculator that applies tiered discounts automatically.

### 2. The Mobile Application
A cross-platform mobile app built with *Kotlin*.
- *Core Feature:* Mirrors the website's functionality with a native, mobile-optimized interface and the same interactive discount calculator.
